## 2.1.0 (2022-03-12)

### Added

- New `TypeList{T}` that can be used to obtain the types of registered services (as opposed to their instances) via the appropriate **IRegistrationSource** `TypeListSource{T}`.
___

## 2.0.0 (2022-01-08)

### Added

- Project now natively supports **.NET 6**.

### Changed

- The `IocScopeVerificationDelegate` does no longer just return a simple string, but rather an instance of the new `IocScopeVerificationResult` entity. This is a breaking change. To keep required changes to a minimum, each `IocScopeVerificationResult` can be implicitly created from and be converted to a string.
- The **Autofac** package has been downgraded from ~~6.3.0~~ to **6.0.0** so that using this package no longer forces updates in consuming projects that may be unnecessary.
